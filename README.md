# cronet-go

Cronet is the Chromium network stack made available to Android apps as a library. Cronet takes advantage of multiple technologies that reduce the latency and increase the throughput of the network requests that your app needs to work.

The Cronet Library handles the requests of apps used by millions of people on a daily basis, such as YouTube, Google App, Google Photos, and Maps - Navigation & Transit.

This experimental project ported Cronet to golang with NaiveProxy support. To learn how to use the Cronet Library in your app, see the [naive-go](./naive/main.go) example.
